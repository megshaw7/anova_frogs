```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

response variable is time (days) the frogspawn took to hatch
explanatory variable is Temperature, with 3 levels: 13째C, 18째C and 25째C.

null hypothesis = temperature will have no effect on the speed of frogspawn hatching.

actual hypothesis = mean frogspawn hatching time will vary with temperature level. We can predict that given our temperature range, at the highest temperature (25째C) hatching time will be reduced.
